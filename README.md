## Background

This repo is intended for any individual wanting to improve their problem
solving skills for Software Engineering interviews.
Problems are grouped under their respective subtopic, in order to focus on
repeatedly applying common patterns rather than randomly tackling questions.

All questions are available on [leetcode.com] with some requiring [leetcode premium].

## Preface

It is highly recommended to read chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 10 of [Cracking The Coding Interview]
to familiarize yourself with the following data structures and their operations:

- Arrays
- Maps
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Heaps
- Stacks
- Trees
- Graphs

In addition, you should have a good grasp on common algorithms such as:

- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Binary search
- Recursion

## Java Syntax Notes

[This pdf] contains useful information for the built-in data structures in Java.
Other useful methods that will help include `substring()`, `toCharArray()`, `Math.max()`,
`Math.min()`, and `Arrays.fill()`.

## Tips to Consider

```
If input array is sorted then
    - Binary search
    - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
    - Backtracking

If given a tree then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a graph then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a linked list then
    - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
    - Stack

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
    - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
    - Heap

If asked for common strings then
    - Map
    - Trie

Else
    - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
    - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
```
